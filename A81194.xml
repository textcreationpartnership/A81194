            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE. TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AT my firſt Entrance into the Study of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> knowing Method and Order conduce much to the enlightning of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, rendring things more perſpicuous, and comprehenſive to the diſcerning Judgment, and ſitting them better for the retaining Memory; I reſolved to obſerve a Regular Courſe, and therefore ſearched for ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and endeavoured to make uſe of ſuch Means as might beſt correſpond with my Deſign therein. But among the ſeveral Treatiſes of the Laws and Government of this Kingdom, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of Courts heretofore written by ſeveral Eminent and Learned Men, finding none were ſo compleat, nor had that
<pb facs="tcp:133291:3"/> Beauty of Order and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity at might be expected. And the Lord-<hi>Coke</hi> in the Epilogue to his Fourth Inſtitutets concerning the Juriſdiction of Courts, deſiring the Wiſe-hearted and Expert Builders would amend both the Method, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, and the Structure it ſelf, where they ſhould find any Deficiency in the Architecture; and conſidering that great Alterations have been made ſince by divers Acts of Parliament and otherwiſe, I was enduced to compile this. Methodical <hi>Compendium of the Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of</hi> England, <hi>and the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions thereunto belonging,</hi> to direct and facilitate my farther Studies. But the Importunity of ſome having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with me to promiſe (contrary to my firſt Intention and Inclination) to make it Publick: If it prove bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to others, it will ſurmount all the Ambition may be thought to be in</p>

                        <hi>Monarchy Regal</hi> was begun by <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> who (after the World began to increaſe) got unto himſelf a Dominion

                        <p>Moreover, beſides <hi>The Law of Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Humane Law,</hi> it was neceſſary for the Direction of Humane Life, to have the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> for Four Reaſons: Firſt, Whereas Man was created to enjoy Eternal Beatitude, it was neceſſary that beſides the <hi>Law of Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Humane Law,</hi> he ſhould be Directed to his End by a Law Divinely inſtituted. Secondly, For the incertainty of Humane Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he ſhould be directed by a Law given by Divine Inſpiration, from which it appeared, that he might by no means deviate. Thirdly, Becauſe the Judgment of Man may not be of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:133291:11"/>Interior Acts; therefore it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to have a Law Divine, which ſhould rectifie the Interiors, as well as the Exteriors of Men, Fourthly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Human Law cannot puniſh every evil Act, it was neceſſary to have a Divine Law, which ſhould let no Evil go unpuniſhed; and theſe four Reaſons are touched in this Verſe,</p>

                     <p>WE muſt know that the Law of <hi>England,</hi> or Humane Law in <hi>England,</hi> takes its Fundamentals from Six chief Principles: Firſt, <hi>The Law of Reaſon.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Divine Law.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Divers Cuſtoms of the Kingdom.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Divers Principles</hi> called
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:133291:12"/>
                        <hi>Maxims.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>Particular Cuſtoms in certain places.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>From divers Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Common Council of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Parliament;</hi> of which we ſhall ſpeak ſomething in order.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, <hi>The Law of Reaſon</hi> is held in this as in all other Kingdoms; and the Learned in the Laws of <hi>England</hi> make two Degrees of the Law of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>(ſcilicet) Lex. Rationis Primariae, &amp; Lex Rationis ſecundariae: Ex Primaria,</hi> From the firſt are forbidden Murder, Manſlaughter, Oppreſſion of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, Perjuries, Deceits and many ſuch like. But the manner of puniſhing theſe ſorts of Offences, is according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Principles and Maxims or Statutes, to this end eſpecially ordained; and it is called the Law of Reaſon primary; For that thoſe things which are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or Forbidden by that Law, are grounded upon Reaſon alſo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Law joyned or oppoſed to it: The Law of Reaſon ſecundary is likewiſe divided in two parts, That is, General and Particular; The Law of Reaſon ſecundary General, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from that Law of Propriety Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which is held throughout the World; From this are prohibited Thefts, Diſſeiſins, and many other, And it is called the Law of Reaſon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:133291:13"/>Secundary, for that it is founded not upon Reaſon alone, but from the Law of Propriety, and the Reaſon derived from that Law; for becauſe the Law of property ſaith, <hi>Such a thing is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Goods of ſuch a Man;</hi> Therefore ſaith Reaſon, grounded upon that Law, <hi>that thing is not to be taken from him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly againſt his Will.</hi> And the Law of Reaſon Secundary Particular, is that which is Founded upon divers Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Particular Cuſtoms, and divers Maxims and Statutes, only had and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> As if a Diſtreſs dye, it ſhall not be imputed to him who diſtrained; but to him who hath the Propriety, becauſe the Defect is to be aſſigned in him, for that he did not pay the Rent: And Reaſon is founded upon the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom aforeſaid, ſo that there need not be any Written Law had thereof. And we find ſo many Secundary Reaſons in the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> that many are willing to affirms the whole Law of <hi>England,</hi> to be proved by Reaſon, which notwithſtanding is by no means to be affirmed, as by another Example.</p>
                     <p>By a certain Statute it is Ordained, That he who hath abjur'd the Realm, whilſt he is in the publick High-way, ſhall be in peace with our Lord the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:133291:13"/>King and not in any ſort moleſted; and by the Cuſtom of the Kingdom, he is to be conducted from Town to Town, by the Conſtables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Sea-port, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if he Eſcape, the Conſtable ought not to be charged to the King, becauſe by reaſon of the Statute, he could not keep him in ſafe Cuſtody, or uſe any Force or Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment whereby he might be kept in ſafe Cuſtody; and the Reaſon is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that Statute. And ſome ſay, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery is to be prohibited from Reaſon Primary, even before the Law of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, for that it was not Lawful even when all things were in Common, to take any thing from another by force, or to throw him out of his Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but that ſuch Robbery is to be puniſhed with Death, is from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Law of <hi>England.</hi> Alſo from the General Law of Property aforeſaid, by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are excepted Birds, Wild beaſts and Beaſts of Warren, in which by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> is no Property to any One, unleſs they be Tame; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> in the Eggs of <hi>Herons,</hi> and ſuch like, Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Woods of any, is a Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And for that every Deduction of Reaſon in the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:133291:14"/>from the firſt Principles, or from ſomewhat from thoſe Principles deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, no Man althô the moſt Wiſe, can Judge juſtly or Argue rightly in the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> if he know not theſe Principles.</p>
                     <p>The Second Fundamental of the Law of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Lex Divina,</hi> whereby to puniſh the Tranſgreſſors againſt the <hi>Divine Law.</hi> The Law of <hi>England</hi> in many Courts of our Lord the King doth Inquire of Hereticks: Alſo if any Statute be made or ſet forth againſt them; as that none ſhall give Alms, it ought to be of no force; alſo, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Excommunicated in the Laws of <hi>England</hi> may not Proſecute, nor have Communication with others whilſt the Excommunication is certified. And from the ſame Fundamental the Law of <hi>England</hi> admits the Spiritual Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Tithes, and other things which do of right belong to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and receives Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical or Eccleſiaſtical Laws, <hi>Quae non Excedunt poteſtatem ferentis:</hi> ſo that in many Caſes it behoves the Kings Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices to Judge according to the Laws of the Church; As if the Law of the Church be, that the Sentence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce is not in force till it is affirmed upon Appeal, The Judges of our Lord
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:133291:14"/>the King, ſhall form their Judgment according to the Laws of the Church; And if <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>C. D.</hi> have Goods and Chattels joyntly, and <hi>A. B.</hi> by his laſt Will, give his part to <hi>E. F.</hi> the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Judges are bound in this caſe to adjudge this Will void.</p>
                     <p>The Third Fundamental of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> is the General Cuſtoms of the Kingdom, which are divers Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Cuſtoms uſed and approved of in Ancient time, throughout the whole Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts any thing againſt them Works againſt Law and Juſtice; And theſe are properly called the Common Law, and ought always to be determined by the Judges, whether a General Cuſtom or not, and not by the Country; and of theſe and other Principles or <hi>Maxims,</hi> a great part of the Law of <hi>England</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; and therefore the King by his Coronation Oath promiſeth <hi>(inter alia)</hi> that he will faithfully obſerve all the Cuſtoms of the Kingdom; and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtoms of the Kingdom, is the Original and Foundation of divers Courts in the ſame Kingdom; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one is <hi>The Chancery</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in which <hi>(inter alia)</hi> Writs origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal are obtained, directed to other Courts of the King; another <hi>The Kings-Bench,</hi>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:133291:15"/>in which are handled all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Murders, Homicides, Felonies, and other things done againſt the Kings Peace; another Court is called <hi>The Common Bench,</hi> in which Common Pleas are handled; (That is to ſay,) of Lands and Tenements, Debts and Chattels and ſuch like; another Court is called <hi>The Kings Exchequer,</hi> in which are handled divers matters touching the King alone, as of Sheriffs, Eſcheats or Receivers, Bayliffs and other the Kings Officers and the like; and theſe are called Courts of Record, becauſe thoſe who preſide as Judges ought to be aſſigned by the Kings Letters Patent; and theſe Courts have many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Authorities, of which we ſhall ſpeak more hereafter in their proper places, and likewiſe of divers other Courts of inferiour Authority in the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> And althô in divers Statutes and Books, mention is made of the Authority of theſe Courts; yet we have no written Law of their Inſtitution; for their Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends upon the Cuſtom of the Kingdom, which hath ſo great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that they may not be altered, or their Names changed or altered, but by Act of Parliament. Alſo there is an Ancient Cuſtom, which is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:133291:15"/>by the Statute of <hi>Marlebridge;</hi> That all ſhall do and receive Juſtice in the Kings Court, and another, that none ſhall be put to Anſwer, or be judged, but according to the Law of the Land; and this is confirmed by <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> And there are other General Cuſtoms in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> which retain the force of Law, as that the eldeſt Son ſhall ſucceed the Father in the Inheritance, and many more, not here to be recited.</p>
                     <p>From whence it appears, that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms in the Laws of <hi>England</hi> may not be proved by Reaſon alone, for how can it be proved by Reaſon, that the Husband ſhall have the Wife's Land for Term of his Life, as Tenant by that Law, and that the Wife ſhall have only the Third part, <hi>ſcilicet,</hi> that it ſhall be ſo done and not otherwiſe? And it is certain, that the Law of Property is not the Law of Reaſon, but a Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Law, and ought to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt the General Cuſtoms of the Kingdom, and there is not any Statute or written Law of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Cuſtoms of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> but according to the Skilful in the Law of <hi>England:</hi> The Ancient Cuſtoms of the Law of <hi>England</hi> are of themſelves of ſufficient Authority;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:133291:16"/>and the Cuſtomary Law is the moſt firm Law, provided ſuch a Cuſtom be not againſt the Law of God, or the Law of Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Fundamental of the Law of <hi>England</hi> conſiſts of <hi>Divers Principles,</hi> which the Learned in the Law call <hi>Maxims,</hi> always eſteemed and held for Law of this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> which none Learned in the Law may contradict, becauſe every one of them gives Faith or Credit to it ſelf; and whether a Maxim or not is to be tried by the Judges, as before is ſaid of General Cuſtoms of the Kingdom, and not by the Country: And theſe <hi>Maxims</hi> are not alone taken for Law, but alſo all other like caſes, and all things neceſſarily following upon them, are to be placed in like Law, and they are in the ſame force and ſtrength in Law as Statutes; and althô all theſe <hi>Maxims</hi> might conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be numbred amongſt the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid General Cuſtoms, ſince Ancient Cuſtom is the ſole Authority, as well of theſe as thoſe; yet becauſe thoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Cuſtoms are diffuſed and known, they may eaſily and without ſtudy in the Laws be known, but theſe Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims are only known in the Kings Courts, or by thoſe who are Learned
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:133291:16"/>in the Law; and now for example ſake we will mention a few of them, ſince to declare them fully great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes would not ſuffice: And firſt, there is a certain Maxim in the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> that no Preſcription in Lands maketh a Right; alſo, that Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Rents and Profits to be taken in the Lands of another maketh a Right; alſo, that the limitation of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is generally taken <hi>à tempore cujus centrarij Memoria hominum non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtit, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further, there are many other Maxims, as in certain Actions, The Proceſs is by Summons, Attachment and Diſtreſs Infinite; and in ſome by <hi>Capias</hi> Infinite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that there ſhould be theſe divers Proceſſes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Actions, may ſeem expedient and reaſonable; but that there ſhould be theſe divers Proceſſes had in the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and none other, cannot be proved by Reaſon; therefore they muſt neceſſarily have their force from the Maxims aforeſaid, or the Ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Kingdom: And ſome Maxims ſeem to be founded upon Reaſon Secundary; and therefore ſome may think they may be put unto the firſt Fundamental of other Laws of <hi>England;</hi> as if any command a Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, he is a Treſpaſſor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:133291:17"/>
                     <p>And there are other <hi>Maxims</hi> and <hi>Customs,</hi> which are not ſo manifeſtly known, but may be known by the Law of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> partly by Books of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> which are called <hi>Year Terms,</hi> partly by <hi>Records</hi> in the Kings Treaſury, and remaining in the Kings Courts; and by a Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Register,</hi> and by divers <hi>Statutes,</hi> in which ſuch Cuſtoms and Maxims are often recited. <hi>Vide Doctor &amp; Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Fifth Fundamental of the Law of <hi>England</hi> conſiſts of <hi>Divers particular Cuſtoms,</hi> uſed in divers Countries, Towns, Lordſhips, or Mannors and Cities of the Kingdom; which ſaid particular Cuſtoms, becauſe they are not againſt Reaſon, nor the Law of God, altho' they are contrary to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid General Cuſtoms, and Maxims of Law, yet they retain the force of Laws: And they ought not always to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Judges, whether there be ſuch a Cuſtom or not, unleſs in a few particular Cuſtoms ſufficiently known and approved in the Kings Courts, but ought to be tryed by the Country: And of theſe particular Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms I ſhall put a few for Example; As there is a Cuſtom called <hi>Gavelkind</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where all the Brothers ſhall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:133291:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>Inherit as the Siſters do at Common Law: By <hi>Burrough Engliſh,</hi> in the Town of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> the younger Son ſhall Inherit: In ſome Countries the Wife ſhall have all the Inheritance of her Husband, in Name of <hi>Dower,</hi> ſo long as ſhe continues a Widow: And in ſome Countries the Man ſhall have half the Inheritance of the Wife du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Life, although he hath no Iſſue by her: In ſome Countries the Infant may make a Feoffment at his Age of Fifteen years: And in ſome Countries, when he can Meaſure an Ell of Cloth; yet ſuch Infant may not make Warranty, for if he do, it is void in Law, neither may he in ſuch caſe make a Releaſe. Thus are held many other particular Cuſtoms.</p>
                     <p>The Sixth Fundamental conſiſts of <hi>Divers Statutes Ordained in Parliament,</hi> when other Fundamentals of the Law of <hi>England</hi> are not ſufficient; for it is to be known, that altho' the Law of Reaſon may be aſſigned to be the firſt and principal Fundamental of the Law of <hi>England:</hi> yet the Law of <hi>Reaſon</hi> is not of ſo great force and efficacy in the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> that it alone being known, all the Law of <hi>England</hi> is known: For beſides the Law of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> he who deſires to know the Laws of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:133291:18"/>
                        <hi>England,</hi> ought to know the Cuſtom of the Kingdom, as well General a Particular, and the Maxims and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of Law, or otherwiſe, altho' h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>From theſe things before contain'd it may be deduced, which often fall out, That in one and the ſame caſe two or three Fundamentals of Law ought to concur together before the Plaintiff may obtain his Right, as by Example may appear: As if any afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:133291:18"/>
                     <p>And it is to be noted, that there are many Cuſtoms, as well General as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and alſo Divers Laws, called <hi>Maxims,</hi> which take not their force from ſtrong Reaſon, but from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Kingdom: For by <hi>Statutes</hi> they may be changed into the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and what can be changed, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be affirmed to be the Law of Reaſon Primary: As for Example; How doth it ſtand with Reaſon or Conſcience, That if one Bound in an Obligation to pay Money, pay part of the Money, but takes no Acquittance, or loſe it; by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> he ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to pay that Money again, becauſe of the General Maxim, That in an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Debt upon Bond, the Defendant may not plead <hi>Nihil debet,</hi> or <hi>Quod poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniam ſolvit,</hi> nor otherwiſe diſcharge himſelf unleſs by Acquittance, or other ſufficient Writing amounting to a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in Law; and this to avoid the great Inconvenience which would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if every one by word alone might avoid an Obligation.</p>
                     <p>And thus having briefly ſet forth the Fundamentals of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> we ſhall proceed to the Government, and the Legiſlative and Executive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>

                        <p>But that we may more clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what Equity is, It is to be known, that becauſe it is impoſſible to inſtitute any General Rule of Law, which will in no caſe be defective, therefore <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators</hi> attend to that which happeneth in many things, and not to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes, nor indeed can they, ſince to obſerve the Sentence of Law in ſome Caſes, is both againſt the Equality of Juſtice and Common Good; ſo that in ſome Caſes it is good, yea abſolutely neceſſary (praetermitting the words of the Law) to follow that which reaſon of Juſtice requireth. And to this end Equity is ordained, which is alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Epicaya, ſcilicet,</hi> to moderate the Rigour of the Law, and it taketh not away the very Right, but that which ſeemeth to be Right, by general deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Law. And caſes may happen in which the Law of God, and the Law of Reaſon, would be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated by the obſervance of them; as in the Law of <hi>England</hi> there is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Prohibition, that it ſhall not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any Man to enter into the Ground of another without Authority of the Owner, or of the Law; yet it is excepted, That if Beaſts by the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way eſcape into another Man's Corn, he that driveth them may juſtifie the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:133291:57"/>Entry to fetch them out; and many other ſuch like. And thus it appears, That Equity rather attends the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the words of Law.</p>
                        <p>And thus having briefly ſet forth what Equity is, we are next to know that this Court of Extraordinary Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction grounded thereupon, relieveth none but ſuch who are without remedy in other Courts; For <hi>nunquam decurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ad extraordinarium, ſed ubi defecit Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarium.</hi>

                        <p>This Court is Superiour to the other Tribunals, that ſo the rigour of the Law in them might be here moderated, and amended according to Conſcience and Equity; and proceeding by Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Bill, the Witneſſes are examined in private; the Decrees in Engliſh or Latin; no Jury, but all Sentences given by the Judge of the Court, much like to the Courts of the Civil Law; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Before the making of this Statute delay of Judgments was forbidden, both by the Common Law and by Acts of Parliament. By the Common Law 1.

And whatever one Juſtice may do, may ever be done by more.</p>
                        <p>And they may be puniſhed for their Neglect.</p>

                     <hi>Scotland</hi> was an Heptarchy, but now a Monarchy; King <hi>James</hi> the firſt, endeavoured in Parliament to make a Union of both Kingdoms: But the Judges Reſolved, That <hi>Anglia</hi> had Laws, and <hi>Scotia</hi> had Laws: But the new Erected Kingdom of <hi>Britannia</hi> ſhould have no Laws; and therefore, till there was a Union of the Laws, there could be no Union of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>

                  <p>The Rule, <hi>Quando duo jura concurrunt in una perſona aequum eſt acſi in diverſis,</hi> holdeth not in Perſonal things; that is, when two Perſons are neceſſarily and inevitably required by Law; For no man can now ſay, That the King of <hi>England</hi> can make War, or League with the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or King of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp;c.</hi> there being but One Head of both; and as Liegance of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of both Kingdoms is due to their Sovereign by one Law, and that is the Law of Nature: So there is a Union of Protection of both Kingdoms equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonging to either of them; altho' in other reſpects they are diſtinct King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. For and Earl or Baron of <hi>Ireland</hi> is not a Peer, or of the Nobility of this Realm, as appeareth by the Book 8 <hi>R.</hi> 2. where in an Action of Debt, Proceſs of Outlawry was awarded againſt the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which ought not to have been if he had been Noble here.</p>

                  <p>But there is a diverſity worthy of Obſervation, for the higheſt and loweſt Dignities are Univerſal; For if a King of a Foreign Nation come into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by leave of the King, (as it ought to be) in this caſe he ſhall Sue and be Sued by the Name of a King; And a Knight ſhall be ſo named whereſoever he received that Dignity, <hi>Co.</hi> 7 Rep. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
                  <p>If a King come to a Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Conqueſt, he having <hi>Vitae &amp; Necis potestatem,</hi> may alter the Laws of that Kingdom at his pleaſure; but until ſuch alteration, the Ancient Laws of that Kingdom remain. But if a a Chriſtian King Conquer the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of an Infidel, there <hi>ipſo facto</hi> the Laws are abrogated, and in that caſe, until certain Laws be eſtabliſhed, the King by himſelf, and ſuch Judges as he ſhall appoint ſhall judge them, and their Cauſes according to Natural Equity, in ſuch ſort as Kings in ancient time did their Kingdoms, before any certain Municipal Laws were given: But if a King have a Kingdom by Title of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, for that by the Laws of that Kingdom he doth Inherit, he cannot change thoſe Laws of himſelf, without Conſent of Parliament.</p>

                        <p>IS the moſt Conſiderable Iſland the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have amongſt the <hi>Caribees,</hi> and lies in 13 Degrees and 20 Minutes on this ſide the <hi>Aequator,</hi> and tho' not above 24 Miles long, and 15 broad, yet was many years ago accounted to have above 20000 Inhabitants, beſides <hi>Negro</hi> Slaves, who are thought a far greater Number. In the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, a Ship of Sir <hi>William Curteens</hi> returning from <hi>Fernambuck</hi> in <hi>Braſile,</hi> being driven by foul Weather upon this Coaſt, chanced to fall upon this Iſland, and Anchoring before it, ſtaid ſometime to inform themſelves of the Nature thereof, which was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly overgrown with Woods, that they could find no Champain or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vana's</hi> for Men to Live in, nor any
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:133291:271"/>Beaſts, but a multitude of Swine, which the <hi>Portugals</hi> put aſhoar long before for Breed, if they ſhould at any time be caſt on that Shoar in foul Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Fruits and Roots that grew there afforded ſo great plenty of Food, as they multiplyed abundantly, ſo that the Natives of the other Iſlands uſe to come hither to Hunt.

So that they can in a ſhort time Arm 10000 Fighting Men, which with the Natural Advantage of the Place, is able to Defy the moſt potent Enemy, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have found to their Coſt, having in vain Aſſaulted it ſeveral times.</p>

                     <p>THE manner of Debates or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Bills into Acts, is thus.

                     <p>It is free for any Man of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or not of the Parliament, to get a Bill drawn by ſome Lawyer, and

After it hath been amended, and twice read two ſeveral Days in the Houſe, then it is Ingroſſed, that is, written fair in Parchment, and read the third time another Day, and then if it be in the Lords Houſe, the Lord Chancellor, in the Commons Houſe the Speaker demandeth if they will have it put to the Queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>a Law or no Law?</hi> If the Major Part be for it, there is written on the Bill by the Clerk, <hi>Soit Baille aux Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munes,</hi> or <hi>Soit Baille aux Seigneurs,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſtill in this and ſome other things about making Laws, the Cuſtom of our Anceſtors, who were generally skilled in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue.</p>

                     <p>If any one ſpeak words of Offence to the King's Majeſty or to the Houſe, he is called to the Bar, and ſometimes ſent to the Tower.

                     <p>And other things whereof this Court hath perfect Cognizance, and that may be enquired of, and puniſhed here in this Court, are, 1. By Common Law, as the Defaults of Officers and Suitors in doing their Suit to this Court; as if any living within the Precinct of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, be not returned of the Decenary, or being returned, does not appear: Or, if any above Twelve years of Age have lived within the Leet, and had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Oath of Allegiance, he was to have been preſented here. And if any ſuch Perſon had come to this Court, the Steward ought to have given him this Oath. If any Cuſtoms or Profits, as Treaſure Trove, Waif, Eſtray, or Wreck be withheld from the Lord of the Leet; or if any claim any Royal Franchiſe, or levy any new Franchiſe, or abuſe any old Franchiſe within the Leet. All common and popular Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances or Grievances done to the Kings Subjects, by Purpreſtures made in any Land, Wood or Water, by Walls, Hedges, Ditches, or Houſes, made up or broken down, by ſtraightning, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtopping, ſurrounding, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hurting the common Ways, Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Waters; by poiſoning or corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Air by laying of any Carrion or Filth, by ſelling of corrupt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom

And for all theſe, be the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend or one Man, or a whole Pariſh, he or they may be Amerced; and the Jury may order the Reforming of them under a Pain. And all great Affrays, Outcries and Bloodſheds, and ſuch like popular Treſpaſſes, which are Treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by the Common Law. Riots, Routs, and unlawful Aſſemblies at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, are puniſhable in this Court; and for this the Offendors are to be Amerced according to Diſcretion; but this muſt be reaſonable, and the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs tryable and avoidable by Plea or Judgment of the Court in which the Suit depends. Evil Members, and perſons of ill Behaviour that are dangerous to the Neighbours, as Malefactors in Parks, ſuch as take Doves by Engines, ſuch as are common ſuſpected Thieves, or that are the common Meſſengers of Thieves, the common Drunkards, the common Haunters of Alehouſes or Taverns, not having whereon to live; Nightwalkers and Day-ſleepers, that live idlely, that have no Eſtate, yet fare well; Eves-droppers, common Hedge-breakers,

Theſe laſt the Steward of this Court heretofore might have bound to the Peace or Good Behaviour, but at this day he can only by the Preſentment of the Jury Amerce them, or make way to have them bound to their Good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour by a Juſtice of Peace.

All that Reſcue Perſons or Things, taken in a courſe of Law; as Reſcuers of Perſons Arreſted; or Goods or Cattel Diſtreined; Pound-breakers and the like. The lack of Stocks, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory and Tumbrel, Cucking-ſtool, or Common Pound. All that uſe Deceit in Buying and Selling, that Sell falſe Wares for good, eſpecially if it be that which is to be Eaten or Drunk; That Sell by falſe Weights and Meaſures, Inn-keepers, Victuallers, Brewers, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Fiſhers, Poulterers, or Fiſhmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that Sell that which is unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for Food, or Sell at unreaſonable Prices; Bakers and Brewers that do not keep the Aſſize of Bread and Beer, and Millers that take exceſſive Toll. Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallers, Regrators and Ingroſſers, may be puniſhed in this Court by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law. And Uſurers as Enemies to Trading. But in theſe and ſuch like Caſes, the Penalty of the Statute can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Impoſed; for Stewards have no Power by the Statutes, but it is puniſhed here as an Offence at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, before the Statute which doth remain ſtill, and for theſe the Offender is to be amerced.</p>

                     <p>The Articles to be enquired of by the Leet, by 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. were inquirable therein by the Common Law.</p>
                     <p>This Court cannot take Indictments of any Felony, for the death of a Man, or in any other caſe where it hath not Cognizance; And if it do it is void, and it ſeems the Judge may be puniſhed for it; Neither can it take a Preſentment of an offence done againſt a Pariſh, or againſt a Man.

And the Maſter of the 10th Houſhold, was by the Saxons called by divers Names, viz. <hi>Theothungmon,</hi> to this day in the Weſt called <hi>Tythingman</hi> and <hi>Tihenheofod,</hi> and <hi>Freoborher i. e.

                     <p>The Court of the Tourn of the County, and of the Leet or View of Frankpledge are very Ancient; for of the Tourn you may Read among the Laws of King <hi>Ed.

                     <p>And becauſe this Court, or View of Frankpledge or Leet, was by the King divided and derived from the Tourn, and granted to the Lords to have the view of the Tenants, and Reſiants within their Manor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo as they ſhould have the ſame Juſtice, as they had before in the Tourn, without any charge or loſs of Time; from thence came the Duty in many Leets to the Lord <hi>de Certo Lete,</hi> towards the charge of obtaining the Grant of the ſaid Leet.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe, and for the ſame Reaſon were Hundreds, and Hundred Courts divided and derived from the County Courts; and this the King might do, for the Tourn and Leet, are both the King's Courts of Record: And as the

And as the County Court, and Hundred Court are of one Juriſdiction; ſo the Tourn, and Leet be alſo of one and the ſame Juriſdiction: For <hi>Derivativa poteſtas est ejuſdem juriſdictionis cum Primitiva.</hi>

                     <p>In all Writs directed to Sheriffs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the County Court, the King ſaith, <hi>In Comitatu ſuo;</hi> and in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of Exigents made by him, he ſaith, <hi>Ad Comitatum meum tentum,</hi> &amp;c. and the Stile of the Court proveth the ſame alſo.

                     <p>And as the Cuſtody of the Entries and Rolls thereof do belong to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Sheriff, he ſhall anſwer for them as immediate Officer to the Court.

                     <p>Reſolved, That if the Plea be holden by Writ or without Writ, the Suitors are Judges. The Reaſon why the Writ is directed to the Lord or Sheriff, is becauſe the Court Baron is the Lord's Court, and the County Court is the Sheriff's Court. And in caſe they hold Plea by force of the King's Writ, it doth not change the Nature and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Court. For as theſe without Writs are not Courts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, ſo when the Plea is holden by Writ, the Courts are of the ſame Nature. For upon a Judgment given in both Caſes, a VVrit of falſe Judgment lieth, and not a Writ of Error. But it is true the King may create a new Court, and appoint new Judges in it; but after the Court is eſtabliſhed and created, the Judges of the Court ought to determine Matters in the Court. And therefore neither the Lords of Ancient Demeſne, nor the Court Baron, nor the Sheriff in the County Court, when the Plea is holden by Writ of Right, <hi>Juſticies,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurement, &amp;c. are Judges; but the Suitors, who by the Common Law are the Judges of the Court.
